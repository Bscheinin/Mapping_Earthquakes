# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. An addtional layer on the map shows major earthquakes as well.

## Tasks
To complete this project, use of several URLs for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days were added to the map. Different layers were added to the map along with overlays showing pertinent data.

## Approach
Use of JavaScript and the D3.js library helped retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and interactivity was created for the earthquake data.
